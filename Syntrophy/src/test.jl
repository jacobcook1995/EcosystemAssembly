# ROUGH SOLUTION LOOK AT TOMMOROW
# basically 3 don't involve changing thermodynamics (dissipation)
# 4 do
# Of these 2 are beneifical, if they can be performed
# But can't guarentee that an increase in reverse rate is always acheivable
# Want to consider case where it isn't and there is a tradeoff


# New stuff to write
# Script to find parameters sets for each tradeoff
# Then function that takes parameter sets for each tradeoff and simulates and makes graphs of tradeoff
# Then loop over for the seven tradeoffs
# From now on use e notation for
# Why not use steady states as initial values => should shift to real value if not
