# Syntrophy Package
Made a package to contain code related investigation of the thermodynamics of syntrophy.
The functions should be contained in a module in Syntrophy.jl.
I keep test scripts in test.jl.
I will have to decide what do when I have a lot of complicated functions at a later date.
At present all images are being plotted into an Output folder, this will have to be changed eventually.
All output data is stored in Data this can probably be preserved.\
