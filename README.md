# Ecosystem Assembly Repository
A repository to store code from my investigations into the thermodynamics of ecosystem assembly.
This code is split into a number of sub-repositories that should all have their own README files.
Potentially these sub-repositories will be made into separate repositories as and when anything here is publication worthy.\
The sub-repositories are as follows:
1) Assembly: work relating to implementing ecosystem assembly models from literature and developing novel ones.
2) Network: work relating to using MaxEPP as a selection principle for reaction networks.
3) Syntrophy: an investigation into the thermodynamic constraints on syntrophic cross-feeding.
