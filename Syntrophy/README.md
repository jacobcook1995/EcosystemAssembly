# Syntrophy Package
Made a package to contain code related investigation of the thermodynamics of syntrophy.
The functions should be contained in a module in Syntrophy.jl.
I keep test scripts in test.jl.
Old functions that are no longer usable but worth saving are stored (temporarily) in grave.jl.
The scripts that I used to plot the graphs used in the Syntrophy SI document are saved in synplots.jl.
I will have to decide what do when I have a lot of complicated functions at a later date.
At present all images are being plotted into an Output folder, this will have to be changed eventually.
All output data is stored in Data this can probably be preserved.\
